AUTOMATIC MOVIE REVIEW ANALYSER USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES
                                    
 This system is developed as a part of acadamic main project. This system can be used predict whether 
the movie review is positive or not. You need to train the system before the prediction. Training means,  
you need to give some movie reviews with the polarity of the texts ( Positive or Negative ) to the system.
  System is fully written using python. You need some extra python modules to make the system work. You
can find the detailed instructions to  install these modules under the 'Installation instructions' sub-
heading.
  You need to copy the 'SourceCode' folder to your linux system and use the below command to run the system

				user@system :~$ python 1.py

 You can find DataSet containing movie reviews in a folder called DataSet.
